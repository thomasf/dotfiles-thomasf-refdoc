<p class="ed">(Clarified that the default value for <i>fromIndex</i> is the
length minus 1 of the array.)</p>

	<p>
	The
	optional second argument <i>fromIndex</i>
	defaults to the array's length <ins>minus one</ins> (i.e. the whole array is searched).
	If it is greater than or equal to the length of the array, the whole
	array will be searched. If it is negative, it is used as the offset
	from the end of the array to compute <i>fromIndex</i>.
	If the computed index is less than 0, -1 is returned.</p>
