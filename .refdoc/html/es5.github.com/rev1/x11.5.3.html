In
the remaining cases, where neither an infinity, nor a zero, nor
<b>NaN</b>
is involved, the floating-point remainder r from a dividend n and
a divisor d is defined by the mathematical relation r = n <span class="symbol">âˆ’</span>
(d * q) where q is an integer that is negative only if n/d is
negative and positive only if n/d is positive, and whose
magnitude is as large as possible without exceeding the magnitude
of the true mathematical quotient of n and d.
<ins>r is computed and rounded to the nearest representable value using
IEEE 754 round-to-nearest mode.</ins>
