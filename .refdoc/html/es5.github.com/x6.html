	<p>
	ECMAScript
	source text is represented as a sequence of characters in the
	Unicode character encoding, version 3.0 or later. The text is
	expected to have been normalised to Unicode Normalised Form C
	(canonical composition), as described in Unicode Technical Report
	#15. Conforming ECMAScript implementations are not required to
	perform any normalisation of text, or behave as though they were
	performing normalisation of text, themselves.  ECMAScript source
	text is assumed to be a sequence of 16-bit code units for the
	purposes of this specification. Such a source text may include
	sequences of  16-bit code units that are not valid UTF-16 character
	encodings. If an actual source text is encoded in a form other than
	16-bit code units it must be processed as if it was first convert to
	UTF-16.</p>

	<p>
	Throughout
	the rest of this document, the phrase &#8220;code unit&#8221; and the word
	&#8220;character&#8221; will be used to refer to a 16-bit unsigned value
	used to represent a single 16-bit unit of text. The phrase &#8220;Unicode
	character&#8221; will be used to refer to the abstract linguistic or
	typographical unit represented by a single Unicode scalar value
	(which may be longer than 16 bits and thus may be represented by
	more than one code unit). The phrase &#8220;code point&#8221; refers to such
	a Unicode scalar value. &#8220;Unicode character&#8221; only refers to
	entities represented by single Unicode scalar values: the components
	of a combining character sequence are still individual &#8220;Unicode
	characters,&#8221; even though a user might think of the whole sequence
	as a single character.</p>
	<p>
	In
	string literals, regular expression literals, and identifiers, any
	character (code unit) may also be expressed as a Unicode escape
	sequence consisting of six characters, namely <code><b>\u</b></code>
	plus four hexadecimal digits. Within a comment, such an escape
	sequence is effectively ignored as part of the comment. Within a
	string literal or regular expression literal, the Unicode escape
	sequence contributes one character to the value of the literal.
	Within an identifier, the escape sequence contributes one character
	to the identifier.</p>
	<p><b class="note">NOTE</b> Although
	this document sometimes refers to a &#8220;transformation&#8221; between a
	&#8220;character&#8221; within a &#8220;string&#8221; and the 16-bit unsigned
	integer that is the code unit of that character, there is actually
	no transformation because a &#8220;character&#8221; within a &#8220;string&#8221; is
	actually represented using that 16-bit unsigned value.</p>
	<p>
	ECMAScript
	differs from the Java programming language in the behaviour of
	Unicode escape sequences. In a Java program, if the Unicode escape
	sequence <code><b>\u000A</b></code>,
	for example, occurs within a single-line comment, it is interpreted
	as a line terminator (Unicode character <code><b>000A</b></code>
	is line feed) and therefore the next character is not part of the
	comment. Similarly, if the Unicode escape sequence <code><b>\u000A</b></code>
	occurs within a string literal in a Java program, it is likewise
	interpreted as a line terminator, which is not allowed within a
	string literal&#8212;one must write <code><b>\n</b></code>
	instead of <code><b>\u000A</b></code>
	to cause a line feed to be part of the string value of a string
	literal. In an ECMAScript program, a Unicode escape sequence
	occurring within a comment is never interpreted and therefore cannot
	contribute to termination of the comment. Similarly, a Unicode
	escape sequence occurring within a string literal in an ECMAScript
	program always contributes a character to the String value of the
	literal and is never interpreted as a line terminator or as a quote
	mark that might terminate the string literal.</p>
