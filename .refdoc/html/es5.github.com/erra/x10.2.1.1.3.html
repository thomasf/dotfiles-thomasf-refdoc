	The
	concrete Environment Record method SetMutableBinding for declarative
	environment records attempts to change the bound value of the
	current binding of the identifier whose name is the value of the
	argument <i>N</i> to the
	value of argument <i>V</i>.
	A binding for <i>N</i>
	must already exist. If the binding is an immutable binding, a
	<b>TypeError</b> is
	<del>always</del>
	thrown
	<ins>if <i>S</i> is <b>true</b></ins>. 
	<del>The <i>S</i>
	argument is ignored because strict mode does not change the meaning
	of setting bindings in declarative environment records.</del>

		Else
		this must be an attempt to change the value of an immutable binding

		throw a <b>TypeError</b> exception.</p>
