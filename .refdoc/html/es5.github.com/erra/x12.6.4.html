<p class="ed">(Implementers have found the spec. to be unclear regarding whether shadowed
  inherited properties are included in an enumeration)</p>
	<p>
	The
	mechanics and order of enumerating the properties (step 6.a in the
	first algorithm, step 7.a in the second) is not specified.
	Properties of the object being enumerated may be deleted during
	enumeration. If a property that has not yet been visited during
	enumeration is deleted, then it will not be visited. If new
	properties are added to the object being enumerated during
	enumeration, the newly added properties are not guaranteed to be
	visited in the active enumeration.
	<ins>A property name must not be visited more than once in any enumeration.</ins>
	</p>

	<p>
	Enumerating
	the properties of an object includes enumerating properties of its
	prototype, and the prototype of the prototype, and so on,
	recursively; but a property of a prototype is not enumerated if it
	is “shadowed” because some previous object in the prototype
	chain has a property with the same name.
	<ins>The values of [[Enumerable]] attributes are not considered when
	determining if a property of a prototype object is shadowed by a previous
	object on the prototype chain.</ins></p>
