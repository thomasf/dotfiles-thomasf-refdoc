	<p>
	The
	range of elements processed by <code><b>reduce</b></code>
	is set before the first call to <i>callbackfn</i>.
	Elements that are appended to the array after the call to <code><b>reduce</b></code>
	begins will not be visited by <i>callbackfn</i>.
	If existing elements of the array are changed, their value as passed
	to <i>callbackfn </i>will
	be the value at the time <code><b>reduce</b></code>
	visits them; elements that are deleted after the call to
	<ins><code><b>reduce</b></code></ins>
	<del><code><b>filter</b></code></del>
	begins and before being visited are not visited.</p>
