	<p>
	Throughout:
	In the Edition 3 specification the meaning of phrases such as &#8220;as
	if by the expression <code><b>new
	Array()</b></code>&#8221; are subject to misinterpretation. In the
	Edition 5 specification text for all internal references and
	invocations of standard built-in objects and methods has been
	clarified by making it explicit that the intent is that the actual
	built-in object is to be used rather than the current dynamic value
	of the correspondingly named property.
	</p>
	<p>
	<a href="x11.html#x11.8.2">11.8.2</a>,
	<a href="x11.html#x11.8.3">11.8.3</a>, <a href="x11.html#x11.8.5">11.8.5</a>: ECMAScript generally uses a left to right evaluation
	order, however the Edition 3 specification language for the &gt; and
	&lt;= operators resulted in a partial right to left order. The
	specification has been corrected for these operators such that it
	now specifies a full left to right evaluation order. However, this
	change of order is potentially observable if side-effects occur
	during the evaluation process.</p>
	<p>
	<a href="x11.html#x11.1.4">11.1.4</a>:
	Edition 5 clarifies the fact that a trailing comma at the end of an
	<i>ArrayInitialiser</i>
	does not add to the length of the array. This is not a semantic
	change from Edition 3 but some implementations may have previously
	misinterpreted this.</p>
	<p>
	<a href="x11.html#x11.2.3">11.2.3</a>:
	Edition 5 reverses the order of steps 2 and 3 of the algorithm.  The
	original order as specified in Editions 1 through 3 was incorrectly
	specified such that side-effects of evaluating <i>Arguments</i>
	could affect the result of evaluating <i>MemberExpression</i>.</p>
	<p>
	<a href="x12.html#x12.4">12.4</a>:
	In Edition 3, an object is created, as if by <code><b>new
	Object()</b></code>to serve as the scope for resolving the name of
	the exception parameter passed to a <code><b>catch</b></code>
	clause of a <code><b>try</b></code>
	statement. If the actual exception object is a function and it is
	called from within the <code><b>catch</b></code>
	clause, the scope object will be passed as the <b>this</b> value of
	the call. The body of the function can then define new properties on
	its <b>this</b> value and those property names become visible
	identifiers bindings within the scope of the <b>catch</b> clause
	after the function returns. In Edition 5, when an exception
	parameter is called as a function, <b>undefined</b> is passed as the
	<b>this</b> value.</p>
	<p>
	<a href="x14.html#x14">13</a>:.
	In Edition 3, the algorithm for the production <i>FunctionExpression</i>
	with an <i>Identifier</i>
	adds an object created as if by <code><b>new
	Object()</b></code> to the scope chain to serve as a scope for
	looking up the name of the function. The identifier resolution rules
	(10.1.4 in Edition 3) when applied to such an object will, if
	necessary, follow the object&#8217;s prototype chain when attempting to
	resolve an identifier.  This means all the properties of
	Object.prototype are visible as identifiers within that scope.  In
	practice most implementations of Edition 3 have not implemented this
	semantics.  Edition 5 changes the specified semantics by using a
	Declarative <a href="x10.html#x10.2.1">Environment Record</a> to bind the name of the function.</p>
	<p>
	<a href="x14.html#x14">14</a>:.
	In Edition 3, the algorithm for the production <i>SourceElements </i><b>:</b> <i>SourceElements
	SourceElement </i>did not correctly propagate statement
	result values in the same manner as <i>Block</i>.
	This could result in the <code><b><a href="x15.1.html#x15.1.2.1">eval</a></b></code> function producing an incorrect result when evaluating a <i><a href="x14.html#x14">Program</a></i>
	text. In practice most implementations of Edition 3 have implemented
	the correct propagation rather than what was specified in Edition 3.</p>
	<p>
	<a href="x15.10.html#x15.10.6">15.10.6</a>:
	RegExp.prototype is now a RegExp object rather than an instance of
	Object. The value of its [[Class]] internal property which is
	observable using <a href="x15.2.html#x15.2.4.2">Object.prototype.toString</a>
  is now &#8220;RegExp&#8221; rather than &#8220;Object&#8221;.</p>
