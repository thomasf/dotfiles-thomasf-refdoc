	<p>
	There
	are certain built-in objects available whenever an ECMAScript
	program begins execution. One, the <a href="x15.1.html#x15.1" class="term-ref">global object</a>, is part of the
 <a href="x10.html#x10.2">lexical environment</a> of the executing program. Others are accessible
	as initial properties of the <a href="x15.1.html#x15.1" class="term-ref">global object</a>.</p>
	<p>
	Unless
	specified otherwise, the [[Class]] internal property of a built-in
	object is <code><b>"Function"</b></code>
	if that built-in object has a [[Call]] internal property, or
	<code><b>"Object"</b></code>
	if that built-in object does not have a [[Call]] internal property.
	Unless specified otherwise, the [[Extensible]] internal property of
	a built-in object initially has the value <b>true</b>.</p>
	<p>
	Many
	built-in objects are functions: they can be invoked with arguments.
	Some of them furthermore are constructors: they are functions
	intended for use with the <code><b>new</b></code>
	operator. For each built-in function, this specification describes
	the arguments required by that function and properties of the
	Function object. For each built-in constructor, this specification
	furthermore describes properties of the prototype object of that
	constructor and properties of specific object instances returned by
	a <code><b>new</b></code> expression
	that invokes that constructor.</p>
	<p>
	Unless
	otherwise specified in the description of a particular function, if
	a function or constructor described in this clause is given fewer
	arguments than the function is specified to require, the function or
	constructor shall behave exactly as if it had been given sufficient
	additional arguments, each such argument being the <b>undefined</b>
	value.</p>
	<p>
	Unless
	otherwise specified in the description of a particular function, if
	a function or constructor described in this clause is given more
	arguments than the function is specified to allow, the extra
	arguments are evaluated by the call and then ignored  by the
	function. However, an implementation may define implementation
	specific behaviour relating to such arguments as long as the
	behaviour is not the throwing of a <b><a href="x15.11.html#x15.11.6.5" class="term-ref">TypeError</a></b> exception that
	is predicated simply on the presence of an extra argument.</p>
	<p><b class="note">NOTE</b> Implementations
	that add additional capabilities to the set of built-in functions
	are encouraged to do so by adding new functions rather than adding
	new parameters to existing functions.</p>
	<p>
	Every
	built-in function and every built-in constructor has the
 <a href="x15.3.html#x15.3.4">Function prototype object</a>, which is the initial value of the expression
	<code><b><a href="x15.3.html#x15.3.3.1">Function.prototype</a></b></code>
	(<a href="x15.3.html#x15.3.4">15.3.4</a>), as the value of its [[Prototype]] internal property.</p>
	<p>
	Unless
	otherwise specified every built-in prototype object has the
 <a href="x15.3.html#x15.3.4">Object prototype object</a>, which is the initial value of the expression
	<code><b><a href="x15.2.html#x15.2.3.1">Object.prototype</a></b></code>
	(<a href="x15.2.html#x15.2.4">15.2.4</a>), as the value of its [[Prototype]] internal property,
	except the Object prototype object itself.</p>
	<p>
	None
	of the built-in functions described in this clause that are not
	constructors shall implement the [[Construct]] internal method
	unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular
	function. None of the built-in functions described in this clause
	shall have a <code><b>prototype</b></code>
	property unless otherwise specified in the description of a
	particular function.</p>
	<p>
	This
	clause generally describes distinct behaviours for when a
	constructor is &#8220;called as a function&#8221; and for when it is &#8220;called
	as part of a <b>new</b> expression&#8221;. The &#8220;called as a function&#8221;
	behaviour corresponds to the invocation of the constructor&#8217;s
	[[Call]] internal method and the &#8220;called as part of a new
	expression&#8221; behaviour corresponds to the invocation of the
	constructor&#8217;s [[Construct]] internal method.
	</p>
	<p>
	Every
	built-in Function object described in this clause&#8212;whether as a
	constructor, an ordinary function, or both&#8212;has a <code><b>length</b></code>
	property whose value is an integer. Unless otherwise specified, this
	value is equal to the largest number of named arguments shown in the
	subclause headings for the function description, including optional
	parameters.</p>
	<p><b class="note">NOTE</b> For
	example, the Function object that is the initial value of the <code>slice</code>
	property of the String prototype object is described under the
	subclause heading &#8220;String.prototype.slice (start, end)&#8221; which
	shows the two named arguments start and end; therefore the value of
	the <code>length</code> property of
	that Function object is <code>2</code>.</p>
	<p>
	In
	every case, the <code><b>length</b></code>
	property of a built-in Function object described in this clause has
	the attributes {&#160;[[Writable]]: <b>false</b>, [[Enumerable]]:
	<b>false</b>, [[Configurable]]: <b>false</b> }. Every other property
	described in this clause has the attributes { [[Writable]]: <b>true</b>,
	[[Enumerable]]: <b>false</b>, [[Configurable]]: <b>true</b> } unless
	otherwise specified.</p>
