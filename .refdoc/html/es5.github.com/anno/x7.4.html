<p>"<code>&lt;!--</code>" is a line comment (same as "<code>//</code>").</p>

<p>In JScript, the following are ignored if they are at the end of the script
(i.e., just followed by whitespace lines):</p>

<p>Either:
<ol type="A">

<li>A line that starts
with just whitespace and comments and consists of "<code>--></code>" followed by
anything except new lines and finally followed by another "<code>--></code>"; or</li>

<li>one or two lines that start with just whitespace and comments and
consist of just "<code>--></code>".</li>
</ol>

<p>"<code>--></code>" at the end of the last line of the script causes
the line to be ignored unless the "<code>--></code>" occurs within a
comment. The last non-whitespace line of the script is ignored if it ends
with "<code>--></code>" and doesn't contain "<code>//</code>" or
"<code>&lt;!--</code>" (but not in <code><b>eval</b></code>).</p>

<p>In SpiderMonkey, "<code>--></code>" on any line that starts with just
whitespace and comments is treated as a line comment (same as
<code>//</code>). (Also, <code>;version=1.6, 1.7 or 1.8</code> or
<code>1;e4x=1</code> enables E4X "<code>&lt;!-- --></code>" comments.)</p>

<p>In Carakan, Nitro and V8, "<code>--></code>" on any line that starts
with just whitespace (but not comments) is treated as a line comment (same
as "<code>//</code>").
