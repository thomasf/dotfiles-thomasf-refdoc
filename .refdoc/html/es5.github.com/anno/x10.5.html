The fixes:

Function declarations are handled by step 5 of 10.5.  The ES5.1 spec. is:

5.     For each FunctionDeclaration f in code, in source text order do
   a.      Let fn be the Identifier in FunctionDeclaration f.
   b.      Let fo be the result of instantiating FunctionDeclaration f as described in Clause 13.
   c.      Let funcAlreadyDeclared be the result of calling env’s
             HasBinding concrete method passing fn as the argument.
   d.      If funcAlreadyDeclared is false, call env’s CreateMutableBinding
             concrete method passing fn and configurableBindings as the arguments.
   e.      Else if env is the environment record component of the global environment then
          i.         Let go be the global object.
         ii.         Let existingProp be the resulting of calling the
                       [[GetProperty]] internal method of go with argument fn.
        iii.         If existingProp .[[Configurable]] is true, then
               1.     Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of go,
                        passing fn, Property Descriptor {[[Value]]: undefined,
                        [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: true , [[Configurable]]:
                        configurableBindings }, and true as arguments.
        iv.         Else if IsAccessorDescriptor(existingProp) or
                      existingProp does not have attribute values {[[Writable]]: true,
                      [[Enumerable]]: true}, then
                1.     Throw a TypeError exception.
   f.        Call env’s SetMutableBinding concrete method passing fn, fo, and strict as the arguments.

The correction for the ES5.1 spec. is:

5.     For each FunctionDeclaration f in code, in source text order do
   a.      Let fn be the Identifier in FunctionDeclaration f.
   b.      Let fo be the result of instantiating FunctionDeclaration f as
             described in Clause 13.
   c.      Let funcAlreadyDeclared be the result of calling env’s
             HasBinding concrete method passing fn as the argument.
   d.      If funcAlreadyDeclared is false, call env’s CreateMutableBinding
             concrete method passing fn and configurableBindings as the arguments.
   e.      Else if env is the environment record component of the global environment then
          i.         Let go be the global object.
         ii.         Let existingProp be the resulting of calling the
                       [[GetOwnProperty]] internal method of go with argument fn.
        iii.         If existingProp is undefined or existingProp .[[Configurable]] is true, then
               1.     Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of go,
                 passing fn, Property Descriptor {[[Value]]: undefined,
                 [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: true , [[Configurable]]:
                 configurableBindings }, and true as arguments.
        iv.         Else if IsAccessorDescriptor(existingProp) or
                      existingProp does not have attribute values {[[Writable]]: true,
                      [[Enumerable]]: true}, then
                1.     Throw a TypeError exception.
   f.        Call env’s SetMutableBinding concrete method passing fn, fo, and strict as the arguments.

The changes are in lines e.ii and e.iii

Larger changes are needed to handle var declaration in step 8 because
special case processing for global declaration similar to what is is step 5
needs to be added.  The corrected ES5.1 spec. adds step 8.d and its
sub-steps:

8.     For each VariableDeclaration and VariableDeclarationNoIn d in code, in source text order do
   a.     Let dn be the Identifier in d.
   b.     Let varAlreadyDeclared be the result of calling env’s HasBinding
            concrete method passing dn as the argument.
   c.      If varAlreadyDeclared is false, then
          i.         Call env’s CreateMutableBinding concrete method
                       passing dn and configurableBindings as the arguments.
         ii.         Call env’s  SetMutableBinding  concrete method passing
                       dn, undefined, and strict as the arguments.
    d.    else if env is the environment record component of the global environment then
          i.         Let go be the global object.
         ii.         Let existingProp be the resulting of calling the
                       [[GetOwnProperty]] internal method of go with argument fn.
        iii.         If existingProp is undefined,    then
               1.     Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of go,
                        passing dn,  Property Descriptor {[[Value]]: undefined,
                        [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: true , [[Configurable]]:
                        configurableBindings }, and true as arguments.
