<p>All objects have a mutable <code>__proto__</code> property that is a
reference to the prototype of the object. Note that the spec required that
objects with extensible:false must not have their prototype mutated. In the
case that setting an objectâ€™s <code>__proto__</code> would cause a prototype
chain to become cyclic, the setter must fail and throw <code>Error()</code>.
