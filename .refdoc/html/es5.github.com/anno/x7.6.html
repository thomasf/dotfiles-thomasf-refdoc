<p>Identifiers containing escape sequences are not equivalent to fully
unescaped identifiers in the case that, after fully unescaping <i>Identifier</i>,
it is a <i>ReservedWord</i>. In particular it is possible to create Identifiers
that unescape to a reserved word so long as at least one character is fully
escaped. Subsequent use of such identifiers must also have at least one
character escaped (otherwise the reserved word will be used instead) but it
need not be the same character(s) as that originally used to create the
identifier.</p>
