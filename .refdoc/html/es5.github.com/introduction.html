	<p>This Ecma Standard is based on several originating technologies, the most
	well known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The
	language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared
	in that company&#8217;s Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all
	subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft
	starting with Internet Explorer 3.0.</p>
	<p>
	The
	development of this Standard started in November 1996. The first
	edition of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the Ecma General
	Assembly of June 1997.</p>
	<p>
	That
	Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the
	fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC
	16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998
	approved the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned
	with ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition
	are editorial in nature.</p>
	<p>
	The
	third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular
	expressions, better string handling, new control statements,
	try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors,
	formatting for numeric output and minor changes in anticipation of
	forthcoming internationalisation
	facilities and future language growth. The third edition of the
	ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of
	December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC 16262:2002 in June 2002.</p>
	<p>
	Since
	publication of the third edition, ECMAScript has achieved massive
	adoption in conjunction with the World Wide Web where it has become
	the programming language that is supported by essentially all web
	browsers. Significant work was done to
	develop a fourth edition of ECMAScript. Although that work was not
	completed and not published
	<a class="footnote" id="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym">[1]</a>

	as the fourth edition of ECMAScript, it informs continuing evolution
	of the language. The present fifth edition of ECMAScript (published
	as ECMA-262 5<sup>th</sup>
	edition) codifies de facto interpretations of the language
	specification that have become common among browser implementations
	and adds support for new features that have emerged since the
	publication of the third edition. Such features include accessor
	properties, reflective creation and inspection of objects, program
	control of property attributes, additional array manipulation
	functions, support for the JSON object encoding format, and a strict
	mode that provides enhanced error checking and program security.</p>
	<p>
	ECMAScript
	is a vibrant language and the evolution of the language is not
	complete. Significant technical enhancement will continue with
	future editions of this specification.</p>

	Note: Please note that for ECMAScript Edition 4 the Ecma standard
	number &#8220;ECMA-262 Edition 4&#8221; was reserved but not used in the
	Ecma publication process. Therefore &#8220;ECMA-262 Edition 4&#8221; as an
	Ecma International publication does not exist.</p>
